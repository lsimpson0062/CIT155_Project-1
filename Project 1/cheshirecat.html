				<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>The Cheshire Cat is a large cat with very long claws, a great many teeth, and he smiles from ear to ear. He can vanish at will, 
					or make only certain parts of his body disappear. He can be found hanging out on tree branches, or at the Duchessâ€™s house who is his presumed 
					owner. He likes to bring up philosophical points, and have puzzling conversations.</p>
				
				<h2>Impact on Wonderland</h2>
					<p>He is most notable for causing a large argument at the Queens croquet game. He appeared at the game to cheer on Alice, but only his head 
					appeared. This caused the King, Queen, and executioner to debate whether a detached head could be beheaded or not. He was also very helpful 
					to Alice at the beginning of her first journey through Wonderland. He gives somewhat confusing directions to the March Hare and the Hatter.</p>
