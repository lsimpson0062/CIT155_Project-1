				<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>The Hatter is a poor man. He makes various personal remarks, and asks many riddles that have no answers. He wears a large top hat with 
					10/6 on the side, a checkered suit, and a polka dot bow tie. The Cheshire cat describes him as mad. He can always be found having a tea 
					party with the March Hare. There is never time to wash their dishes between whiles so there is an abundance of tea accessories on the table.</p>
					
				<h2>Impact on Wonderland</h2>
					<p>He is most notable for "murdering time" when he sang poorly for the Queen of Hearts. She hated it so much she sentenced him to death, 
					which he escaped from. In retaliation for the Hatters slip, Time stops himself, resulting in it always being teatime (6:00pm) forever. 
					The Hatter was the first witness at the Knave of Hearts trial alongside Alice. He was so nervous during the trial, he could barely get out 
					his testimony.</p>
