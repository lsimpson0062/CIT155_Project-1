				<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>Alice is a very curious little girl. Her birthday is May 4th, 1858; her seventh birthday is her first trip to 
					Wonderland. She comes from a wealthy family allowing her to attend a day school, have a governess that teaches her 
					lessons every day, and a nurse. She has an older sister, and three cats: Dinah and her two kittens. Alice is thought to be loving, gentle, 
					courteous to all, trustful, and well-mannered by many people. </p>
					
				<h2>Time in Wonderland</h2>
					<p>While in Wonderland Alice meets several residents, including the Hatter, Cheshire Cat, the March Hare, the Red Queen and King, Tweedledee 
					and Tweedledum, Humpty Dumpty, the White Queen and King, and many more. Each trip to Wonderland usually got her into a lot of trouble, but 
					two events are quite important. Her first time, she is a witness at the trial of the Knave of Hearts. During her second visit, she becomes a 
					queen, and attends her party that is far too quickly ruined by the Red Queen.</p>
